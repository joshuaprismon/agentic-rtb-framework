From the command line:

1. Install `make` and the latest version of `protoc`.
2. Open the `Makefile` and choose the language(s) for which the Protocol Buffers
   object code should be generated.
3. Run `make`.

## Go Reference Implementation

A Go implementation of the IAB Tech Lab's **Agentic RTB Framework (ARTF) v1.0** specification for agent-driven containers in OpenRTB and Digital Advertising.

### Overview

This project implements a multi-protocol server that conforms to the ARTF specification, enabling:

- **Segment Activation** - Activate user segments based on bid request data
- **Deal Management** - Activate, suppress, and adjust deals dynamically
- **Bid Shading** - Optimize bid prices using intelligent pricing strategies
- **Metrics Addition** - Add viewability and other metrics to impressions

### Supported Protocols

| Protocol | Port | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| gRPC | 50051 | Native RTBExtensionPoint service |
| MCP | 50052* | Model Context Protocol for AI agents |
| Web UI | 8081 | Browser-based testing interface |
| Health | 8080 | Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes |

*When both Web UI and MCP are enabled, MCP is served on the Web UI port (8081) at `/mcp` for simplified load balancer configuration.

### Quick Start

#### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`) v3.21+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

#### Critical Dependencies

The following tools must be installed to generate protobuf code:

| Tool | Version | Installation |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `protoc` | 3.21+ | System package manager or [releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) |
| `protoc-gen-go` | 1.34+ | `go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest` |
| `protoc-gen-go-grpc` | 1.4+ | `go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest` |

**Important:** Ensure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is in your `PATH`:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Go module dependencies (managed via `go.mod`):

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `google.golang.org/grpc` | 1.64.0 | gRPC framework |
| `google.golang.org/protobuf` | 1.34.1 | Protocol Buffers runtime |
| `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` | 0.43.1 | Model Context Protocol server |

#### Build and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
make deps

# Generate protobuf code
make generate

# Build the server
make build

# Run with all services enabled

```

#### Docker Deployment

```bash

### API

#### RTBExtensionPoint Service (gRPC)

```protobuf
service RTBExtensionPoint {
  rpc GetMutations (RTBRequest) returns (RTBResponse);
}
```

#### MCP Tool: extend_rtb

The MCP server exposes an `extend_rtb` tool that accepts OpenRTB bid requests and returns proposed mutations.

### Supported Intents

| Intent | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ACTIVATE_SEGMENTS` | Activate user segments by external segment IDs |
| `ACTIVATE_DEALS` | Activate deals by external deal IDs |
| `SUPPRESS_DEALS` | Suppress deals by external deal IDs |
| `ADJUST_DEAL_FLOOR` | Adjust the bid floor of a specific deal |
| `ADJUST_DEAL_MARGIN` | Adjust the deal margin |
| `BID_SHADE` | Adjust the bid price |
| `ADD_METRICS` | Add metrics to an impression |

### Configuration

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--listen` | "" | Bind address for all services (default: all interfaces) |
| `--external-url` | "" | External base URL for load balancer (rewrites all service URLs) |
| `--enable-grpc` | true | Enable gRPC server |
| `--enable-mcp` | false | Enable MCP server |
| `--enable-web` | false | Enable web interface |
| `--grpc-port` | 50051 | gRPC server port |
| `--mcp-port` | 50052 | MCP server port (ignored when both Web and MCP enabled) |
| `--web-port` | 8081 | Web interface port |
| `--health-port` | 8080 | Health check HTTP port |

#### Load Balancer Configuration

When deploying behind a load balancer, use `--external-url` to ensure all generated URLs point to the external address:

```bash
./artf-agent --enable-grpc --enable-mcp --enable-web \
  --external-url "https://rtb.example.com"
```

This configures the agent so that:
- Web UI and MCP are served on the same port (8081)
- The MCP endpoint URL shown in the Web UI will be `https://rtb.example.com/mcp`
- All health and service URLs use the external base URL

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Test gRPC endpoint (requires grpcurl)
make grpc-test

# Test MCP endpoint
make mcp-test

# Check health endpoints
make health-check

# Send sample requests via MCP
make sample-banner
make sample-video
make sample-bidshade
```

### Security

This implementation follows ARTF security requirements:

- Runs as non-root user
- Drops unnecessary capabilities
- Read-only filesystem
- No external network access (configurable)
- Health probes for Kubernetes integration

### Documentation

- [Implementation Specification](docs/00-EXAMPLE.md)
- [MCP Integration Guide](docs/01-MCP.md)

### AI Assistant Integration (MCP)

The ARTF agent can be added as an MCP server to AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol, giving them access to the `extend_rtb` tool for processing OpenRTB bid requests.

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "artf": {
      "command": "/path/to/artf-agent",
      "args": ["--enable-mcp", "--enable-grpc=false"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

After saving, restart Claude Desktop. The `extend_rtb` tool will be available for RTB mutation requests.

#### Claude Code (CLI)

Create a `.mcp.json` file in your project root or home directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "artf": {
      "command": "/path/to/artf-agent",
      "args": ["--enable-mcp", "--enable-grpc=false"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Or add to your existing Claude Code settings.

#### Remote MCP Server (HTTP)

For remote deployments, run the agent with MCP enabled and connect via HTTP:

```bash
# Start the agent with MCP over HTTP
./artf-agent --enable-mcp --enable-web --web-port=8081

# MCP endpoint will be available at: http://localhost:8081/mcp
```

For Claude Desktop with a remote server, use an MCP proxy or configure your client to connect to the HTTP endpoint.

#### ChatGPT

ChatGPT does not natively support MCP. However, you can:

1. **Use the Web UI** - Access the built-in testing interface at `http://localhost:8081`
2. **Custom GPT with Actions** - Create a Custom GPT that calls the MCP HTTP endpoint via Actions (requires exposing the endpoint publicly)
3. **API Integration** - Use the gRPC or MCP HTTP API directly in your application

#### Available MCP Tool

Once connected, the following tool is available:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `extend_rtb` | Process OpenRTB bid request/response and return proposed mutations |

Example prompt: *"Use extend_rtb to activate segments for a user born in 1990 viewing a sports website"*
